[ ] Include sample web test template
[ ] Include sample service test template
[ ] Fix logging colours, during mvn clean install and during console output
[ ] Add logging to file
[x] Product preferences should ideally be sourced from an external file. In tests, could use test property file
[ ] Separate the 'find preferred store' method into a different port, covered by a separate test?
