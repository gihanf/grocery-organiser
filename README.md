TODO
[ ] Add support for bower
[ ] Include usual javascript libraries
[ ] Include sample web test template
[ ] Include sample service test template
[ ] Fix logging colours, during mvn clean install and during console output
[ ] Add logging to file
[x] Product preferences should ideally be sourced from an external file. In tests, could use test property file
[x] Separate the 'find preferred store' method into a different port, covered by a separate test?
[/] Perhaps the 'find preferred store' method only needs a product name not a whole product. Kept as product for future features
[x] Remove the hardcoding of preferred products in java
[ ] Flesh out all services for remaining stores, UDAYA, IGA
[ ] Experiment and make a manual .enex file, send to email and see if it can be imported into notes
